Over the last year, I've built the platform that powered [PeCan+ 2022 CTF](https://pecanplus.cyberedu.space/). This blog series aims to cover the design decisions and technical implementation that led to a successful CTF - and hopefully help other CTF organisers along the way.

## Background

PeCan+ is an annual two-day event established by Edith Cowan University (ECU, in Perth) and the Australian National University (ANU, in Canberra). It's designed to introduce high-school students to a broad range of cybersecurity topics, and traditionally runs onsite at university campuses over a weekend in September. Saturday is a training day, with presentations and workshops from academics, university students, and industry representatives. Sunday is reserved for a Capture The Flag (CTF) event to focus on practical cyber skills.

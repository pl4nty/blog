After a few years of working on the [PECAN+ cybersecurity event](https://pecanplus.ecusri.org/), it's about time I did a writeup. No challenge solutions though - you'll have to wait for PECAN+ 2024!

## Introduction

PECAN+ started as a cyber training weekend for high-school students, run by Edith Cowan University and the Australian National University. Over time it evolved into a training day and fully-fledged Capture The Flag (CTF) competition with around 500 students from across the country. I've been working on the tech stack for a few years, and faced some pretty unique challenges along the way.

PECAN+ was pretty lean from the start. We can't rely on experienced challenge authors or a large infrastructure team - almost all our authors are new to writing CTF challenges or CTFs in general, and the infra team is just me. So I focused on ease of use and automation to save as much time as possible.

## Scoreboard

CTF scoreboard software doesn't just track teams and points, it's also the interface for challenges, and can have a huge impact on how a CTF plays out. The de-facto standard is [CTFd](https://github.com/ctfd/ctfd), but it had limited automation support in 2021 so I deployed [rCTF](https://github.com/redpwn/rctf) on Azure ([here's the template](https://github.com/ECUComputingAndSecurity/PeCanCTF-2022-Public/tree/main/infra/rctf)). It was great - fast (loadtested at 10k RPS), valuable features like scoreboard categories, and very easy to deploy. Unfortunately it was abandoned soon after and was pretty broken by 2023. In the meantime, CTFd had beefed up their automation tooling, and offered paid hosting to avoid worrying about its [well-known](https://youtu.be/fGxy-O39dYA) [performance](https://medium.com/@iamalsaher/the-admin-side-of-evlzctf-2019-ccb77d45c74d#:~:text=We%20can%20see%20the%20workers%20just%20timing%20out%20and%20rebooting%20and%20WE%20HAD%20NO%20EXPLANATION%20WHY.) [issues](https://medium.com/@sam.calamos/how-to-run-a-ctf-that-survives-the-first-5-minutes-fded87d26d53#:~:text=We%20%E2%80%9Cfixed%E2%80%9D%20this%20through%203%20techniques). The transition went pretty smoothly, and we intend to stick with it next year, but there are a few downsides:

* US hosting causing poor latency to Australia. Also affected downloads, with a Cloudfront CDN that needed manual cache warming
* Managed by a vendor, who took down our instance for maintenance shortly before the CTF  (but quickly fixed it)
* Challenge hosting limits - capped number of chals and CPU/RAM, basic networking, and unscalable multi-container challenges
* Plugins behind an expensive tier

It also doesn't natively support different scoreboards for team divisions (eg beginner, intermediate, advanced). There's a [plugin](https://github.com/durkinza/CTFd_Split_Scoreboard) but I ran out of time to update it for the latest CTFd version, so I wrote a script to parse division winners from a scoreboard export:

```PowerShell
$scores = Import-Csv '.\PECAN+ CTF 2023-scoreboard.csv' | where "Non-student team" -eq $false | select @{n='score2';e={[int]$_.score}},* | sort score2 -Descending
$scores | where "All-female team" -eq $true | select -First 1 "user name", score2
$scores | where "Indigenous player(s) in team" -eq $true | select -First 1 "user name", score2
$scores | where Division -ceq "beginner" | select -First 4 "user name", score2
$scores | where Division -ceq "intermediate" | select -First 4 "user name", score2
$scores | where Division -ceq "advanced" | select -First 4 "user name", score2
```

## Challenges

We had a few communication channels to cover a wide audience (Discord, email, etc), but we centralised challenge development on a GitHub monorepo. This ensures everyone can access challenge content and writeups, along with providing pre-configured development environments via [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). It was also easy to automate challenge deployment using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), at first to [Azure Kubernetes](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/kubernetes-service) with [rCDS](https://github.com/redpwn/rcds) and later to CTFd hosting with [ctfcli](https://github.com/CTFd/ctfcli). Kubernetes was complex to setup but pretty bulletproof with a combination of [AGIC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-overview) for web chals and a layer 4 loadbalancer for pwnables. CTFd was simple but much less flexible, and we had to reject at least one challenge. I ended up writing a [Kubernetes ctfcli plugin](https://github.com/pl4nty/ctfcli-deploy-kubernetes) shortly after the CTF - maybe we'll use it next year.

Testing and quality control has always been difficult for PECAN+, sometimes more than the actual challenges! The monorepo provides helped with visibility and keeping authors accountable (submitting a few hours before the CTF isn't ok ðŸ˜…), and testing will be a major goal next year. Hopefully I'll integrate it with pull requests in my [CTFd automation template](https://github.com/pl4nty/auto-ctfd), which automates formatting, testing, peer review, and deployment.

## Environment

Solving CTF challenges often requires niche tools that are difficult to install and configure, especially for first-time competitors. It's particularly difficult for students, who might be unwilling (or unable) to install "hacking" tools on their school laptops. PECAN+ competitors were also competing from university campuses and networks that might not appreciate suspicious traffic. We needed to provide easy access to the necessary tools with minimal impact on student devices or networks.

I've previously worked on cybersecurity training environments ("cyber ranges"), but the popular options (Skillable, bespoke VMware, etc) were often designed for long-term training programs with a steep learning curve. We settled on Azure Lab Services, which provides on-demand virtual machines (VMs) via RDP or SSH. Microsoft's team were really helpful and made sure onboarding went smoothly. Plus we could scale up to hundreds of VMs automatically, or shut down unused VMs to reduce costs. It worked pretty well with minimal effort, as long as the custom RDP and SSH port ranges were provided *in advance* to university network teams... Causing some last-minute headaches in 2022. Whoops. More on that later.

Kali Linux (despite the stereotypes) was an easy pick for the VM image - it had most of the tools we needed with minimal configuration. I patched the [build scripts](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-cloud) to support Azure and [built an image with WSL](https://github.com/ECUComputingAndSecurity/PeCanCTF-2022-Public/blob/main/infra/README.md). The build was slow and [disk-destroying](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4699) but enough for PECAN+ 2022.

By the time 2023 rolled around, an official Kali Azure image had released, but the image license broke with Lab Services so I was stuck with the build scripts. This time I wanted something quick and repeatable in case I needed to fix bugs at short notice. Turns out Kali upstream (Debian Salsa) were using self-hosted GitLab Runners for automated image building, so I spun up a [Kubernetes executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes.html) in my [homelab](https://github.com/pl4nty/homelab/blob/main/kubernetes/oke/gitlab-runner.yaml) and got building. I also wrote a [script](pecan-vm-setup.sh) to automate some post-build customisations:

* Lab Services agent compatibility fixes
* Pin to Kali last-snapshot sources - somehow this isn't the default on a last-snapshot image
* Install tools eg kali-linux-default
* xRDP and performance tuning
* Blank wallpaper and new tab page - this ended up being manual via Lab Services' snapshot process

Most students weren't comfortable with SSH so xRDP was critical, but tuning it was a rabbit hole. [TCP buffers were tiny](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/issues/1483),  [Win11 removed a faster protocol](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/issues/2400), and we had a whole classroom of [p2p Ubuntu desktops](https://gnosia.anu.edu.au/wiki/Lab_Machine_(CSTS)) using [Remina](https://remmina.org/) with slow default settings. Sometimes the solution is just logging into each desktop and changing the settings ðŸ™ƒ

Besides performance, we also had to grant access with unique and secure accounts - some students wanted to pwn each other rather than the actual challenges. I used a quick script to generate accounts and distributed the credentials in a CSV. I also [patched our 2022 scoreboard](https://github.com/ECUComputingAndSecurity/rctf) to support single sign-on with these accounts, but that was too complex in hindsight.

```PowerShell
Import-Module Passphraser
$accounts = @()
0..599 | % {
    $_ = '{0:d3}' -f $_
    $passphrase = New-Passphrase -Separator "-" -AmountOfWords 2
    $account = @{
        $upn = "player$_@ctf.ecusri.org"
        $username = "Player $_"
        $password = $passphrase.Substring(0,1).ToUpper()+$passphrase.Substring(1)+"1"
    }
    $accounts += $account
    
    az ad user create --user-principal-name $account.upn --display-name $account.username --password $account.password 
}
$accounts | Export-Csv
```

Next year, we're planning to try [Kasm Workspaces](https://kasmweb.com/) for its one-click access and web-based interface. Hopefully it'll avoid any university network port blocking, and tt's also a fair bit faster than RDP. I did have a crack at [WASM-powered Kali](https://pl4nty.github.io/webvm/) but it's not quite ready yet...

## Operations

I felt well-prepared but something always goes wrong. Discord was invaluable for quick issue triage/repro, especially with broken challenges or flaky infrastructure. There's still a lot we can improve on though:

* Rigorous challenge testing - several challenges had flag typos or missing files, let alone performance issues or flag-overwrite exploits
* Infrastructure monitoring - CTFd and Lab Services are pretty opaque by default, Kasm should help
* Triage and comms - issue statuses need to be clear and actionable, especially for non-technical volunteers

These will be the main infra goals for 2024.

## Conclusion

Thanks for making it this far! If you're interested in supporting a CTF with incredible real-world impact, hit me up - PECAN+ 2024 is going to be bigger and better than ever. If you're running a CTF, I'd love if you checked out my [CTFd automation template](https://github.com/pl4nty/auto-ctfd) and let me know what you think. I also want to thank [Michelle Ellis](https://au.linkedin.com/in/dr-michelle-ellis-4bb72493) and [Paul Haskell-Dowland](https://au.linkedin.com/in/pdowland) for their passion and vision to build PECAN+ over the years, and grow it into such a success.

That's all I've got for now, see you in 2024 ðŸ˜Š
